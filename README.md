# Asynchrone-SPDIF-Mixer
"Asynchronous SPDIF Mixer" is a C++ solution designed to synchronize and mix two asynchronous S/PDIF streams into a single S/PDIF output stream at 48kHz. It compensates for drift and uses interpolation for smooth audio transitions, developed for the STM32H723 board and built using CubeIDE for real-time audio processing.
